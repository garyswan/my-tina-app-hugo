Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease, mainly characterized by inflammation (pain, heat and swelling) of the lining, or synovium, of the joints. It can lead to long-term joint damage, resulting in chronic pain, loss of function and disability. It can affect the joints and other organs of the body. The hands, feet and knees are commonly affected. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis but there are ways to manage it.
