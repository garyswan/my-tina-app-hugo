Epilepsy is a tendency to have recurring seizures. There are many different types of seizures but they are always due to abnormal electrical activity somewhere in the brain. Many people will have one seizure at some stage in their lives, but this is not necessarily epilepsy because there is a low risk of recurrence. Many children with epilepsy will eventually ‘grow out of it’ by the time they reach adulthood. For some people, the tendency to recurrent seizures may be a lifelong predisposition.

Around 2% of people will develop epilepsy at some stage in their life, that is around 94,000 children and adults in QLD alone. At Sunshine Butterflies we provide a safe and inclusive environment for individuals and their families living with Epilepsy and offer many supporting services to assist with their needs.
