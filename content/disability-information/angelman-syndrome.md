Angelmans Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder affecting approx. 1 in every 15,000 to 20,000 people. Angelmans Syndrome affects the nervous system and cause severe physical and intellectual disability. Typical characteristic include delayed development, usually noticeable from 6-12 months of age, severe language impairment, movement and balance problems (ataxia), frequent seizures (epilepsy), socialable behaviour with frequent smiling and in 85% of cases a small head size (microcephaly).
