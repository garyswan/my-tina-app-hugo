Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease, which affects the central nervous system. The nerve fibres, which make up our central nervous system and transmit messages from our brain, throughout our body, are wrapped in a fatty sheath, made of a substance known as Myelin. In MS, the Myelin sheath is attacked causing inflammation or damage. Areas of scarring (Sclerosis) result and these scars can disrupt or even block signals within the brain and spinal cord. These scars may cause loss of nerve fibres as well as their ensheathing myelin.

The disruption or blocking of nerve signals within the central nervous system causes a variety of symptoms, depending on which areas of the brain and spinal cord are affected. Symptoms may include:

* Loss of coordination/clumsiness
* Speech difficulties
* Hand shaking/tremor
* Loss of bladder/bowel control
* Extreme fatigue
* Sight impairments
* Memory lapses
* Vertigo
* Weakness
* Impaired sensation

Early symptoms are usually mild. MS is a progressive disease and as time goes on, symptoms may become more severe.
