Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autism are both general terms for a group of complex disorders of brain development. In varying degrees Autism for many, is a condition that presents substantial challenges for those affected. ASD is described as a lifelong developmental disability characterised by marked difficulties in social interaction, impaired communication, restricted and repetitive interests along with behaviours and sensory sensitivities.

According to the Australian Advisory Board on ASD, 1 in 160 Australian children aged between 6 and 12 years old have ASD, making it more common than many other childhood conditions. There are gender differences of Autism, with boys four times more likely than girls to have Autism.

Autism is a lifelong condition although the social, communication and sensory deficits that some experience may be remediated with the use of intervention, therapies and structured support. At Sunshine Butterflies we support inclusion for people on the Autism Spectrum and believe that each individual is truly unique.
