Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) refers to any damage to the brain that occurred after birth. Common causes of ABI include accidents, stroke, lack of oxygen and degenerative neurological disease. ABI-related disability can affect cognitive, physical, emotional and independent functioning. The long-term effects of brain injury are difficult to predict. They will be different for each person and can range from mild to severe.

It is common for many people with ABI to experience increased fatigue (mental and physical) and some slowing down in how fast they can process information, plan and solve problems. They may experience changes to their behaviour and personality, physical and sensory abilities, or thinking and learning.

Helpful advice for family members:

* have good information about the effects of ABI
* appreciate the difficulties that might be encountered
* understand that recovery is a slow process.

For carers to cope with the situation, it helps to:

* stay with the present, rather than brooding about how catastrophic the future may be
* highlight strengths and daily achievements, rather than the weaknesses
* make time to care for themselves
* be wise enough to ask for help when it is needed.
