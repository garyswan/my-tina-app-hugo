Sunshine Butterflies presents ‘Who’s Who at the Zoo’ with Michael White.

Who’s Who at the Zoo is designed for educators, guidance officers, chaplains, principals, team members, managers, supervisors and business leaders, and anyone else who would like to use knowledge of personality types to develop more effective teams.

Introduced in 2005, AusIDentities uses a system based upon four ancient Temperaments that were brought into modern-day use by American Psychologist Dr.David Keirsey. These temperaments are then linked to the characteristics of four well-known Australian Animals; the Eagle, the Dolphin, the Kangaroo and the Wombat, creating a fun and user-friendly system. Through this system people of all ages and from all walks of life are able to develop a greater understanding of the individual work styles of others. Managers and business leaders especially benefit, although in reality, anyone who is a part of a team, or who would like to understand themselves better will also benefit from attending.

This will be fun, lively and an easy to digest two-hour introduction to the world of personality types experienced through the lens of AusIDentities.

Hosted by Professional Trainer and creator of Aus Identities, Michael White, who has kindly donated his time for this one-off exclusive session.
