The Playground at 'Our Backyard' has a variety of **fun and accessible play spaces for all ages.** 

Including an accessible nest swing, soft fall throughout, wheelchair-accessible paths and ramps, an adventure treehouse, water play features with a natural stream and wishing well, sand, water and mud play all accessible from a wheelchair and sensory activity panels throughout.

Kindergarten groups, inclusive playgroups, school groups, community groups, mothers groups, community organisations and children with disability accessing therapies love to use our playground regularly.

Currently, we only have the capacity to offer **pre-organised playgroups, events and group bookings** at our Accessible Playground at 'Our Backyard'.

For pre-arranged group bookings and playgroups, we ask for a **$5 entry fee** for each child visiting, adults are free. **This fee helps us cover maintenance costs** so that we can provide a safe, clean and accessible space for everyone to come and enjoy.

_We don't want anyone to miss out on visiting the wonderful playground, so if you are experiencing financial hardship and aren't able to afford this, please don't hesitate to contact us and we can arrange an alternative._

If you would like to come and check out Sunshine Butterflies Accessible Playground please contact us at admin@sunshinebutterflies.com.au or call 5470 2830 to **organise your visit.**
