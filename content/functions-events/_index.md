Throughout the year we organise and host a **number of events, in conjunction with local community groups and local businesses.**

These Events include Sunshine Butterflies Triathlon, our annual Walk in Wings, Morning Teas, Networking events, Disability Action Week festivities and our Family Day.

We also host regular Mums and Bub's playgroups, welcome groups from early learning centres and schools as well as host our much-loved Christmas Party for our members and their families.

These community events assist us to **raise awareness and much-needed funds for Sunshine Butterflies**, to help us provide support and services to people with disability.

**If your organisation, or business would like to be a part of one of our events,** please contact our Events team on 07 5470 2830.

**All events are advertised on our website and via Social Media.**
