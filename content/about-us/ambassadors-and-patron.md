## Bob Abbot - Patron

Former Sunshine Coast and Noosa Mayor Bob Abbot has been supporting Leanne Walsh and her vision since 2005.

Leanne said the support of the then Mayor was one of the major reasons she “got back in the saddle” to give fresh hope and encouragement to so many families dealing with a loved one in need of care.

Bob Abbot has been an integral part of our community from the very beginning and still plays a major role in any of Sunshine Butterflies events, celebrations and achievements.

## Alexa Leary from 'Move for Lex' - Ambassador

Alexa Leary from 'Move For Lex' is a proud Ambassador for Sunshine Butterflies.

For those who do not know Alexa’s story. On July 17th 2021 the local Noosa triathlete was involved in a traumatic bike accident which lead to her suffering significant and life-changing brain injuries.

Alexa is now recovering with the help of her incredible family, partner and the amazing community who have rallied behind her.

Alexa came to Volunteer with Sunshine Butterflies and instantly fell in love with the environment out here. She is a source of inspiration to many of our members and her bubbly energy is contagious. We're excited to have Alexa at our upcoming events and activities and love the positive message she spreads within our community and beyond.

## Jimmy and Tam Winners of "The Block" 2020 - Ambassadors

Jimmy and Tam connected with Sunshine Butterflies in 2021 as they wanted to get involved with a local charity after relocating back home to the Sunshine Coast. The duo saw that Sunshine Butterflies was making a huge difference in the lives of people with a disability. "It's so amazing to see how happy all of the members are at Sunshine Butterflies, it's inspirational, and we are so proud to come on board!"-Tam
