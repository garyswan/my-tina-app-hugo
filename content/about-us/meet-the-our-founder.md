## Leanne Walsh - Founder/CEO

Leanne's passion and dedication towards disability education, awareness and inclusion **began together with her husband Damien and their son Curtis** who was born 13 weeks premature with Cerebral Palsy.

Leanne’s desire to make her **community an inclusive and accepting place** has earned her numerous awards that include; a Rotary International Paul Harris Fellow, QLD Disability Action Week Awards and Australia Day Local Legends Award.

It is because of her **commitment and contribution** that Leanne has made big changes in the lives of people with disability and their families.

## _"Having a child with disability is a lifelong thing. It doesn’t go away when they turn a certain age or leave school. Support needs to be effective and ongoing, catering for individual circumstances"_

Leanne has created a successful concept through Sunshine Butterflies that has received ministerial recognition and it is because of **Leanne’s enthusiasm, love and devotion towards her son Curtis** that Sunshine Butterflies continues to flourish, thrive, prosper and grow to promote and support others in their **mission for acceptance within an inclusive and supportive community.**
