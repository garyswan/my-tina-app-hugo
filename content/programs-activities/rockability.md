**Rockability**

Our Rockability program provides people with disability with the opportunity to enjoy and create music together.

Coordinated by our professional Muso's, 'Rockability' play and enjoy music together from a broad range of music genres in a fun and educational environment to develop positive group harmony and friendships.

Making music gives our members a unique opportunity to share ideas and create and learn together.

Our 'Rockability' program also perform at local concerts and at events for our friends and family!

**Please email admin@sunshinebutterflies.com.au or call 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in this program, or any of our daily recreational, educational or life skills programs.**
