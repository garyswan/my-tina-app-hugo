**Kiss My Art**

This program provides people with disability the opportunity to communicate and express themselves through creating art. 

Work alongside each other in a stimulating and supportive environment to develop social and artistic skills. Our support workers will assist you to create stunning works of art!

Participants can either join in on group projects or develop their own areas of interest and focus on individual creative goals.

Activities include mosaics, textiles, sculpture, painting, drawing, craft, sewing, jewellery making, photography, tie-dye, weaving and farm art just to name a few.

**Give us a call on 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in 'Kiss My Art'**
