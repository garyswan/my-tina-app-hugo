We are excited to be launching our very first ‘Walk in Wings’, proudly brought to you by @cerge\_app Your Digital Concierge. Come and join us on Friday 19th November 2021 for a 1.5km accessible walk along the Noosa River to celebrate all abilities in our community. Walkers will create a kaleidoscope of colours as they embrace the playfulness of life and the importance of creating an all-inclusive community in their colourful butterfly wings or in purple. We invite you to join us in breaking down barriers and elevating awareness of our neighbours and friends living with disability.
