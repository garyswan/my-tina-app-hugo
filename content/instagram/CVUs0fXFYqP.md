Sunshine Butterflies hosted our first-ever campout at ‘Our Backyard’ with our ‘Commando Outdoor Education' program. ⛺️ We are so proud of our adventurous group of campers who have been working towards this goal for a long time. They enjoyed an evening at ‘Our Backyard’ camping in style amongst nature. Our members set up bell tents, gazebos and their new handcrafted campers chairs by the dams ready for a great night! The evening consisted of bush stew on the fire, toasted marshmallows and an outdoor movie night under the stars. ✨ It was a fabulous overnight camp for our members, who got to enjoy the experiences of being in the outdoors amongst nature and completing all camp related tasks independently. We can’t wait to host more campouts at ‘Our Backyard’!😃
