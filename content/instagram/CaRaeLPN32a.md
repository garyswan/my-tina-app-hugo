22/02/2022 2:22 pm! Happy Twosday!✌️😃 We love our dates at Sunshine Butterflies. Our members continuously quiz each other on upcoming significant dates and 'Pinch and Punch for the first day of the month' is always played at 'Our Backyard'. We thought it would be fun to commemorate a pretty awesome date that won’t be seen for over 200 years. We took a big group pic and made a wish at exactly 2:22pm today! Even if you aren't too fussed about numerology or the number 2, we still think it's a pretty cool event! Happy 22022022 day!
