2021 Walk in Wings!!💜🦋 Today Sunshine Butterflies hosted our very first ‘Walk in Wings’ event!😃 The local community, businesses, organisations, schools and people from all walks of life joined us at the Noosa River for an all-accessible inclusive 1.5km walk to help raise awareness and celebrate people of all abilities. The sun was shining and the birds were singing as we all walked in wings along the beautiful Noosa River, creating a sea of purple. Walk in Wings has been an 11-year long dream for Founder/CEO Leanne Walsh and to see it come to life today was truly special. There were games, face painting, entertainment from Nugget at Hot 91, songs from Sunshine Butterflies members and amazing prizes for ‘Most Unique Wings’, ‘Biggest Wings’ and ‘Most Colourful Wings’. Seeing the community unite and walk as one was nothing short of amazing. 💜 A huge Thank You to our Major Sponsor @cerge\_app 'Your Digital Concierge' our Corporate Sponsor's @teambodycorporate , @mcgrathnoosa and all the amazing people who made this day possible: @hot91sunshinecoast Sam, Ash and Nugget Our Ambassador's @jimmyandtam @whitehouseinternational @ikatanspanoosa @vulyplay @headsofnoosa Our wonderful staff, members, volunteers and supporters. “Butterflies come in different shapes, sizes and colours, some are even broken but they are still beautiful and capable of flying”🦋 What a magical day! We cannot wait to do it again next year!😍 #walkinwings
