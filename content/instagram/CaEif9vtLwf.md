Say hello to Sunshine Butterflies new Admin & Program Support, Lisa!😃🥳🦋 You may recognise Lisa from her bubbly British accent on our phones. We are so excited to have Lisa on board for 2022, supporting our incredible Sonia on the front desk. This smiley duo are the friendly faces you see when you pop into our Main Office!☺ Lisa was born and bred in Liverpool, England but has been living in Australia for 8 years. Lisa was previously a Vet Nurse for 17 years before coming to Sunshine Butterflies. Her amazing animal skills sure do come in handy when working on a farm. “My favourite thing about my role is the family feel that you get at Sunshine Butterflies. It feels like home. I also really love the variety in my job role and my new work buddy, Sonia” We are so thrilled to have Lisa as part of the crew and love watching the superstar Admin and Program support team kick goals, these ladies rock!🤩
