Did you know that 1 in 5 people in Australia are living with some form of disability? This week we are helping to celebrate and raise awareness for individuals living with disability through Disability Action Week. Disability Action Week is held annually in September with the aim to empower people with disability, raise awareness of disability issues, and improve access and inclusion throughout the wider community. At Sunshine Butterflies our vision is to empower individuals living with disability and their families and provide them with the support they need to live a happy and fulfilled life. Sunshine Butterflies Triathlon is a way we have celebrated and recognised this important week. Sunshine Butterflies Tri is catered to all abilities and focuses on creating an environment that promotes health and wellbeing, access and inclusion. We hope you enjoy this wonderful video that represents a very special day at Sunshine Butterflies. P.S Thanks to the awesome The Timing Wizards for supplying us with our 'Butterfly Purple' arch. How great does it look?
