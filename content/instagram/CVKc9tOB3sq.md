What an amazing night at Noosa Arts Theatre Charity Fundraiser for Sunshine Butterflies!😃 Our team and CEO/Founder Leanne Walsh enjoyed a lovely evening watching the show, Pygmalion. It was a fantastic night with a great crowd! This event raised over $1600 from ticket sales and raffle tickets on the night, with the prize proudly donated by Gibsons Homewares Licensed Cafe Catering.👏 These funds will go towards Sunshine Butterflies, helping to support those living with disability and their families. Thanks to the Noosa Arts Theatre, cast, crew and volunteers for a fabulous night! And a big shout out to everyone who bought tickets to this event!
