Sunshine Butterflies ‘Chippies Corner’ have been working on a very exciting project!😀🔨 Members in this program have been working hard on creating a GIANT chess board from scratch. Our 'Chippies Corner' team have been crafting chess pieces and painting and preparing the outdoor chess board outside the Activity Shed. They were so excited today to see all their hard work pay off. We have some huge chess lovers at Sunshine Butterflies and nothing is better than a mega-sized board to get everyone involved. Chess is great for developing and refining patience, concentration and learning, while also enhancing social and interpersonal skills. Plus, a bigger chessboard makes for bigger fun!👏 Well done to our ‘Chippies Corner’ members who have done such an amazing job!💜 We can’t wait for a game of chess on the lawn.
