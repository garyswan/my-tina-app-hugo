Are you making your wings this weekend? 😃🦋 There’s only 6 days to go before ‘Walk in Wings’! Get your friends, kids and family together and have a fun activity decorating your very own pair of wings. It’s an easy and fun activity for people of all ages and abilities. We recommend grabbing some glue, glitter glue, sparkles, various sequins and a few paintbrushes for your wing makeover. If you really want to make your wings stand out, then some beads, tinsel and ribbons are a fun and creative addition. Some places we recommend to purchase your wings from are: @bigwaustralia @choicethediscountstore @spotlightstores @kmartaus Remember there’s prizes for “MOST UNIQUE WINGS”, “BIGGEST WINGS” and “MOST COLOURFUL WINGS”. Don’t forget to register via the link in our bio. #walkinwings
