Today we had the wonderful team from @visitnoosa visit us at 'Our Backyard' ðŸŒ±ðŸ¦‹ We took Lee, Adam and Susan on a tour of our 15-acre community facility and checked out some of our programs happening today. We popped into the 'Purple Thumbs' Gardening program to check out the progress of their tomatoes and mushrooms and had a little dance with the 'Rockability' group. Thanks for taking the time to come and visit our space and see what Sunshine Butterflies is all about. We can't wait to have you back.
