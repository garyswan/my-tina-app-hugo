Sunshine Butterflies 2021 Walk in Wings!ðŸ¦‹ðŸ’œ On Friday 19th November local businesses, organisations, schools, sporting groups and individuals from all walks of life joined Sunshine Butterflies for a 1.5km accessible walk to celebrate all abilities in our community. It was an incredible morning as we all walked together in our colourful butterfly wings, creating a kaleidoscope of colour along the Noosa River. Walk in Wings will be an annual event that will bring the community together to break down the social and physical barriers that people living with disability face daily. A huge thank you to everyone who made Sunshine Butterflies very first Walk in Wings event possible: @cerge\_app @teambodycorporate @mcgrathnoosa @hot91sunshinecoast Sam, Ash and Nugget Our Ambassador's @jimmyandtam @whitehouseinternational @ikatanspanoosa @vulyplay @headsofnoosa @pangaproductions Our amazing supporters, members, staff and volunteers.
