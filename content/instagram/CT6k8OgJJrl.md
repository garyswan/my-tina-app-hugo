We welcomed some lovely visitors from The Salvation Army Australia Coolum Home League out to â€˜Our Backyardâ€™ this week.ðŸ˜€ The Salvation Army Home League is an important meeting point for many women in the community. It has long offered and continues to offer support, guidance, fellowship and friendship for a great many women. We were thrilled to have this group out to â€˜Our Backyardâ€™ for a delicious morning tea in our Training and Education room and a tour of our space. The Salvation Army Coolum League enjoyed a full tour of our facilities, which included a meet and greet with our farm animals in our stable yards, a stroll through our lush gardens and lawn area and a visit to our fabulous cooking program. We were thrilled to show this group around our community facility and share our history and vision for the future.ðŸ’œ If you are a community group and would like to have a morning tea and tour of Sunshine Butterflies space, please contact community@sunshinebutterflies.com.au.
