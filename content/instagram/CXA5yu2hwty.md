Today we are celebrating @idpwd\_au International Day of People with Disability! 🎉 IDPwD is a United Nations observed day celebrated internationally. It aims to increase public awareness, understanding and acceptance of people with disability and celebrate their achievements and contributions. This years theme is “Fighting for rights in the post-COVID era.” This year, we are celebrating the challenges, barriers and opportunities for people who live with disabilities, in the context of a global pandemic. We created a video that reflects on how far we have come in the last 2 years and the achievements of our members living with disability. We hope wherever you are, you are celebrating this important day! 💜
