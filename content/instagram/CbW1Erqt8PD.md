Happy @worlddownsyndromeday !üíú World Down Syndrome Day is celebrated on the 21st day of the 3rd month. Signifying the uniqueness of the triplication (trisomy) of the 21st chromosome, which causes Down syndrome. Each year the voice of people with Down Syndrome, and those who live and work with them, grows louder. But there is still so much more we can do. At Sunshine Butterflies we cultivate an environment of inclusion through the services we provide, employment options, housing opportunities and friendships. We advocate for our members and amplify their voices in the community and nationwide. We believe that everyone deserves to be invited, welcomed, accepted and included in all aspects of society. Today we encourage you to get the conversation started in your workplace, school and home. ‚ÄúWhen a flower doesn‚Äôt bloom we fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower‚Äù Alexander Den Heijer For more resources please visit: https://www.worlddownsyndromeday.org/ #inclusionmeans #worlddownsyndrome
