THRILLERRR!☠️❌ Things got spooky today at Sunshine Butterflies…👻 Our talented ‘Drama Kings & Queens’ performed their Halloween show ‘Thriller’ to families, staff and members. We had a delicious morning tea on our social deck, with scary muffins created by our kitchen team. Our members had a fabulous time performing their Halloween show in our Activity Shed to all their loved ones. There were screams, squeals and a lot of extra scary vibes around 'Our Backyard' this morning as our members wowed us all with their concert. A huge thank you to our amazing Program Coordinator Fem for putting this show together.💜 Thanks to the Good Shepherd Lutheran College Rite Journey students for creating an excellent Halloween backdrop for the show. We are so proud of all our 'Drama Kings and Queens', what an amazing performance!
