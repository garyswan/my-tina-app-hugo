Today Sunshine Butterflies â€˜Kiss My Artâ€™ program hosted their end of year exhibition!ðŸ˜ƒðŸŽ¨ Members in this program have been working hard on various art pieces over the last term in preparation for this exhibit. There were Christmas baubles and decorations, paintings, drawings, mosaic and more on show. Our staff and Volunteers came into 'Kiss My Art's' makeshift exhibition space to view the art and listen to our members speak about their favourite pieces. A huge thank you to our Art Program Coordinator Sally for inspiring and encouraging our members and bringing this exhibition together. Thanks to all our crafty staff and volunteers for the passion they bring to â€˜Kiss My Artâ€™. And lastly, well done to all our â€˜Kiss My Art-istsâ€™ who blew us away with their creativity. ðŸ’œ We cannot wait to open this up to the public in 2022.
