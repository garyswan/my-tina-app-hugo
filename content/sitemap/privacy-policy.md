Sunshine Butterflies is committed to protecting the privacy of an individual’s personal information. The following sets out how we aim to protect the privacy of your personal information, your rights in relation to your personal information managed by us, and the way we collect, use and disclose your personal information.

In handling your personal information, we will comply with the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act)_ and with the thirteen Australian Privacy Principles in the _Privacy Act._

We have policies and procedures in place to ensure that:

**How we collect personal information**

Participant personal information may be collected from:

We will collect personal information directly from you unless:

● we have your consent to collect the information from someone else

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us; although you should be advised that this may impact on our capacity to provide services.

**Disclosure of personal information**

We may disclose your personal and health information, for the purpose of your care and services, to:

● service providers who assist us in providing care and services, medical practitioners, external health agencies such as the ambulance service, hospitals, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and other relevant government organisations

● a person you have nominated as being your advocate, e.g. parent, child or sibling, spouse, a relative, a member of your household, a guardian, an enduring power of attorney, or a person you have nominated to be contacted in case of emergency, provided they are at least 18 years of age.

We may not use or disclose personal information for a purpose other than providing care and services, unless:

● you have consented

● the purpose is related to providing care and services, and you would reasonably expect disclosure of the information for that purpose

● we believe on reasonable grounds that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health or public safety
