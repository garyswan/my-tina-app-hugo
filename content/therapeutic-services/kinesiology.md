Kinesiology is a natural health therapy that uses a science-based tool called muscle testing to gain information about a person’s overall health.

Based on the principle that muscles are related to the body’s meridian energy lines, a practitioner will apply gentle pressure to a main muscle.

Guided by the physical and energetic response of the body a Kinesiologist is able to identify problem areas and the best way to correct any imbalances."""

Kinesiology sessions are carried out in a private relaxed space. The treatment starts with an initial chat to relay information and to discuss what the focus is for the appointment. During the session you may lay on a massage table for comfort or sit if you prefer.

Honouring the holistic health model, we recognise a person may be experiencing ill health on a physical level but underlying imbalances may exist on other levels such as mental, emotional and spiritual.

A combination of modern-day techniques and ancient wisdom are applied during treatment and often a session can include aspects such as; healing the past, restoring balance to the present day and implementing strong foundations for a positive healthy future."""

Illness is often the body’s way of expressing an imbalance. If we choose not to listen to the message it can get louder and louder until it stops us in our tracks.

So whether you have any personal concerns, are suffering from any health issues or you simply feel ‘not quite right’ a Kinesiology consultation with Narissa can determine what is the priority for you.
