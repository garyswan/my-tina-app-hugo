Being surrounded by water can help with **sensory processing, physical exercise, improved socialization and communication skills** and developing better self-regulation.

Water exercise helps **strengthen muscles in the entire body**, including the heart, improves coordination, a larger range of motion, improves balance and increases physical endurance.

Being submerged in our heated swimming pool at 'Our Backyard' makes the body feel lighter **providing a sense of weightlessness.**

This buoyancy can alleviate fears of injury i**ncreasing confidence to try new movements** that might not be attempted on land.

Other **physical benefits of aquatic therapy** include reduced pain and stress for joints and muscles, a strengthened core, improved fine motor skills, enhanced breathing control and even increased oral motor skills.

Our skilled exercise therapists and swimming instructors can help **you or your loved one build confidence in the water and gain all the benefits** that Aqua Therapy provides.

**To book an Aqua Therapy session, please call Sunshine Butterflies on 07 5470 2830**
