At Sunshine Butterflies we **deliver a range of vibration therapies** that help improve blood flow, stimulate relaxation, support a strong immune system and decrease inflammation.

There are many **diverse ways** this therapy is used – from helping to enhance tissue recovery following an injury, to addressing mental and emotional challenges from anxiety. 

_All participants are pre-screened to assess their suitability for Vibration Therapy._

##### Cycloid Vibration Therapy

The cycloid vibration is a **very gentle therapy** that produces 3-dimensional waves in a circular motion.

Cycloid Vibration Therapy has a **positive effect on the lymphatic, cardiovascular, neural and myofascial tissue** that decreases stress and tissue tension to promote calmness and relaxation.

##### Power Plate Vibration Therapy

The power plate **stimulates the nervous system, myofascial system and circulatory system** to increase muscle activation and blood flow.

Power Plate Vibration Therapy is **precise, predictable and safe** which is what we refer to as harmonic vibration that has an uplifting effect.

This type of vibration delivers micro hits of ground-reaction force to **improve tissue health, resilience and function for overall wellbeing.**

It enhances **strength and mobility,** promotes motor learning and motor control and enhances mood and energy levels.
