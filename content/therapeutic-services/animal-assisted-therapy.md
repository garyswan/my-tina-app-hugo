Our one-on-one ‘Animal Enrichment Sessions’ assist people of all ages to **care for and interact with our farm animals in a safe and supportive environment.**

Each session provides individualized instructions depending on the participants' **needs and confidence with animals.**

Participants **develop various life skills** that help build self-esteem, confidence, and shape positive behaviours and social skills.

Our experienced animal instructors and support workers provide social and emotional support with every session and **tailor the activities to suit the needs of each participant.**

_Some of the benefits may include:_

* Improving mood
* Developing communication skills to connect with others
* Lowering anxiety and decreasing agitation
* Encouraging self-expression
* Decreasing isolation and depression

_Our ‘Animal Enrichment sessions’ allow people to experience the benefits of a human-animal bond through fun and safe farmyard activities._

**‘Our Backyard’ is home to a variety of farm animals** including 3 miniature horses, a donkey, a horse, a goat, several sheep, dogs, chickens, guinea fowl, ducks, peacocks and aviaries of budgies and cockatiels.

Learning how to communicate with animals using body language and caring for them and helping maintain their living environments, can help **improve social engagement, self-esteem and self-efficacy.**

**Liberty Training in the Roundyard**

Sunshine Butterflies also offers Liberty Training as part of our Animal Enrichment Sessions.

Liberty Training enables the participant to **develop a true connection with the horse, pony or donkey by learning their language and becoming aware** of how their body movement affects the animal’s behaviour.

You will learn how your **moods, emotions and movements** can affect the animal’s behaviour.

This learning can be as subtle or as deep as the person wants to go. Once a person makes that connection, they learn how to maintain this for longer periods of time and **trust between both animal and human begins.**

**Sally Clay - Animal Carer**

Sally Clay, our animal carer, is a very experienced horse trainer and horsemanship educator and has extensive experience in herd-based equine therapy programs.
