**SUPPORTED INDEPENDENT LIVING (SIL/ILO)**

Supported Independent Living is designed to give people with disability a place to call home in a supported environment.

We can assist you to live a full life, achieve your goals and develop independent life skills, self-confidence and self-reliance to feel safe in your community.

Our team of professional, caring staff will work with you and your family to identify what you want and need. You can choose a Supported Independent Living environment where we manage the property, help match up suitable tenants and provide caring and experienced support staff - 7 days a week, or you can choose Individualised Living Options that lets you choose the home you live in and set up supports in the way that best suits you.

Through either option, we will encourage you to learn new life skills and develop new friendships.
