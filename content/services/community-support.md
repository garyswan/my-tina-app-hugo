##### Community Support

Let us help you with your day-to-day activities, achieve your personal goals and get involved in your community.  We can find the perfect support worker to assist in your personal development and help you every step of the way.

**It’s all about you!**

Looking for something else just for you?

If you are interested in participating one-on-one in any of our activities or programs, on a day that suits you, please contact us and we can arrange a Support Worker to assist you.

**If there is an activity that you wish to do, that we don’t offer, we can work with you to make it happen!**

**Please email admin@sunshinebutterflies.com.au or call 07 5470 2830, if you would like further information.**
