Friday 6th October 2023 we will be holding our annual Walk in Wings.

This event is designed to promote whole community inclusivity and will unite schools, community & sporting groups, businesses and the general public from all walks of life.

Walkers will create a kaleidoscope of colour as they embrace the playfulness of life & importance of creating an all-inclusive community in their colourful butterfly wings or in purple.

We invite you to join us in breaking down barriers and elevating awareness of our neighbours and friends with disability.

Together we can create an inclusive and accepting community for all."""

These barriers include stereotyping and usually assuming that people with disability have a poor and unhealthy quality of life. This is usually because of a lack of community understanding. Yet, in reality, people with disability are like everyone else, we all have our strengths and our weaknesses.

Walk in Wings focuses on creating community awareness and celebrating the wonderful differences that each and every one of us has.

Walk in Wings is an annual event that brings the community together to break down the social and physical barriers that people with disability face daily. 

Together, let's ‘Walk in Wings’ and create awareness of and celebrate people with disability in the community."""
