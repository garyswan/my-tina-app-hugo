After her rough start to life Ruby has come a long way; she is now a boisterous 8 year old who doesn’t let her cerebral palsy hold her back! Ruby has great spirit and love for life; she enjoys ballet, books, playing with sand, using her walker and is an absolute joy to meet and spend time with!

Ruby’s diary has always been full of a variety of appointments; physio, occupational therapy, conductive education, horse riding, feldenkrais, hip surveillance, speech therapy and the list goes on! The early years are the most formative and she is ambitious to achieve her full potential.

Contributions for Ruby will go towards an Intensive Therapy Program run by The Neurological and Physical Abilitation Centre (NAPA) which has an incredible success rate. The cost of the program is $10,120 which goes for 3 weeks, 4 hours of intensive therapy each day. This will give Ruby the opportunity to focus on select therapies that will suit her, such as; NeuroSuit, Cuevas Medak Exercise, Oxygen Therapy, Physical Therapy, etc. It is beneficial for Ruby to gain access to the program in her early years as this will give her a good foundation for an independent environment.

Ruby’s family are hoping to raise enough funds to get her into four sessions within the next 12 months; the four sessions Ruby has already attended have already proved greatly beneficial. In fact they have been so beneficial that her scale of CP has been reduced from a level 4 to a level 3; this is extremely rare! Ruby has also managed independent steps through this therapy program!

With your help, we will be able to give Ruby every opportunity to better her life. Every cent you donate will assist us in taking a step in the right direction.

Thank you for your support and well wishes!
