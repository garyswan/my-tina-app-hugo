Unfortunately after 20 years as an elite athlete Marayke has been diagnosed with an overuse injury to her arms and now not only lives in extreme pain but requires a modified van to drive while still in her motorised wheelchair, as she is unable to propel a manual wheelchair and transport it in her current vehicle.

Imagine going from being so strong you can lift your body weight with one hand to being so weak you drop a piece of toast, and not only that being forced to stay at home because you cannot afford a suitable mode of transportation.

Imagine if every time you went to work you became bedridden in agony for up to a month because you had to use inappropriate transport – this is a reality for Marayke now as when she travels to every motivational speaking job she is required to go in a car or maxi taxi and causes her extreme discomfort.

Yet Marayke remains motivated to continue working and contributing to the community. She has overcome so many obstacles through the thoracic outlet syndrome including an inability to type or use the mouse by now using voice dictation to control her computer so that she can continue her role as a motivational speaker, sharing her journey to becoming a Paralympian in the hope it inspires others to chase their dreams.

Your support and kind donations are greatly appreciated and will make a huge difference in Marayke’s life and what she can continue to achieve. Thank You!
