Abbey was a dream baby, however I started to investigate a few physical and developmental concerns when she was only 5 weeks old, by 16 months old she had been admitted to hospital 5 times, had a CATscan, X-rays, blood tests, MRI and an EEG.

By the time she was 2 Abbey had been clinically diagnosed with A-Typical Rett Syndrome, at 8 years old she was finally genetically diagnosed with White Sutton Syndrome, Epilepsy, Autism level 3, Global Developmental Delay, PICA, Sensory Processing Disorder, PDD-NOS and Self injurious behaviour.

She started walking at 3.5 yrs, she is non stop babbling and signing some very simple words but cannot talk.

These were all things we were told she'd never do.

These things have all happened due to the extensive amount of therapies she has received. Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Hydrotherapy, Music Therapy, Swimming Lessons, Kinesiology and Physiotherapy.

We treat Abbey like any other 8 year old, but she still needs many more years of therapy, specialist appointments, medication and hospital stays.

Some of these things are not covered by her NDIS package so we use your donations to help purchase these things. She attends an amazing special school near our home and loves it!

If you would like to donate towards Abbey's continual progress, we will be extremely grateful and it will be forever appreciated by our family!

Abbey would tap under her chin, which is her way of saying THANKYOU!

Thank you in advance,

Love, Lucy and Josh xoxoxox
