Prader-Willi Syndrome cannot be prevented nor can it be cured. Because of his condition, Beau suffers from low muscle tone, no thermostat to regulate his body temperature, respiratory problems and a compromised immune system leaving him prone to lung infections, he also suffers development delays and short statue requiring growth hormones to control. To be eligible for the growth hormones, Beau is required to keep under a certain weight and the difficulty with this is people with Prader-Willi Syndrome are ravenously hungry and weight management is a constant issue for them.

To help with Beauâ€™s weight management and other symptoms, he is required to be involved in regular exercise and therapy programs. These include; swimming lessons, a personal trainer numerous times per week, speech therapist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and a specialised dietician. These all come a huge cost for our family so we have set this page up to help relieve some of the financial pressure and still being able to provide Beau with the care and support he requires.

Your support and generosity is so greatly appreciated by our family and will make such a difference in our life. From the bottom of our heart, we thank you!
