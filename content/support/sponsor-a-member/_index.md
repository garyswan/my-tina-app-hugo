## How Personal Fundraising can help you:

- Members are able to raise the funds needed to achieve their goals by using the security of a registered charity with deductible gift endorsement.
- Sunshine Butterflies will help members create their own personal fundraising page online.
- Members are able to send their page link to friends, family and colleagues who can read their story, make a donation and leave a personalised message.
- Personal Fundraising allows prospective donors to give directly to an appeal of their choice.
- Creating a personal fundraising page is quick, easy and most importantly secure. Donations are collected online and automatically transferred to Sunshine Butterflies who will then allocate the amount to the individual, family or group once the desired goal is reached.
