Miniature donkeys come in various shades of grey, brown, tan and black. Donkeys are friendly and loyal creatures. Jimmy's soft fur makes for **pleasant belly rubs,** and his curious ears will stand up straight when he meets someone new.

Donkeys are **great therapy animals as they are clever, patient, shy and strong-willed,** so if you want them to co-operate, you need to **observe and understand** what they are telling you with their **body language.**

Donkeys respond best if **you are calm and gentle,** so remember this when you approach Jimmy.

Jimmy is a wonderful addition to ‘Our Backyard’, he is a cheeky lad who loves a good play with his horse friends. He is a **great companion to everyone. **

Sponsor Jimmy to **help us provide the best care and home for our cheeky friend.**
