Geese are highly social animals. **If they are raised around other livestock and fowl, they usually get along well with them.**

Goose is actually the term for female geese, male geese are called ganders. **A group of geese on land or in water are a gaggle,** while in the air they are called a skein.

The Geese at ‘Our Backyard’ love their own space but are dedicated guardians to our ducklings. **Though they hiss and honk, they don’t bite and are very friendly.**

The geese at ‘Our Backyard’ **cruise around looking good and are full of attitude.**

Sponsoring our Geese **helps us to keep their natural areas clean and thriving so they can swim, sunbake** and enjoy 'Our Backyard'.
