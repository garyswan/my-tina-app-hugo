**Chickens are great companions** and looking after them is a great opportunity to connect with the animal world.

There has been interesting research that has shown the many **health benefits of spending your time caring for chickens!**

The chickens at 'Our Backyard' have many jobs. They are happy to **devour our kitchen scraps and veggies,** they also eat bugs and worms, seeds and nuts, grass and wait for it…weeds!

Our chickens also **supply eggs for use in our cooking program**.

We have a flock of chickens who take care of the pests in our gardens. They help keep our gardens weed and pest free. 

In our hen house, we also have **Roosters. **

**Roosters are our natural alarm clock as they wake up at dawn and start crowing loudly. Our Roosters are sweet-natured bantam roosters who are social and friendly. **

**Unlike other birds, roosters cannot fly. **They can take off for a short distance but do not fly for long. Roosters also use their wing span to go faster while running. 

**We have the ideal habitat for rearing chickens, **a large space with small size flocks and a lot of herbs, grasses and plants. Some people keep pet roosters just for their friendly, social and docile nature.

**Our roosters are bantam roosters and "King of the girls". Their job is to keep the girls safe. **

By sponsoring our Chickens, **you will help us feed and provide a warm and safe home for them. **
