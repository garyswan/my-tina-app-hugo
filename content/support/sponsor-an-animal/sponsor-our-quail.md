Quails are covered with brown, black, white, grey and blue feathers. **They are able to fly short distances but spend most of their time on the ground.**

Our Quail Ruby’s job is to clean the floor of our dove house and she is very **fussy about her housework only stopping to eat, drink and sleep.**

Ruby lays beautiful brown and blue speckled eggs and **she makes cute little whistle noises so listen carefully.**
