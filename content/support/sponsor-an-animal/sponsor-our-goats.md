‘Major Lazer’ is a Nubian goat at ‘Our Backyard’ **who is a fun and playful fellow.**

Nubian goats have been bred from hot climate goats which is well suited to Australian conditions. **Major Lazer responds very quickly to affection and makes a very distinct nagging noise.**

Major Lazer **loves pats, grooming, hanging out with everyone and coming on walks around the farm**, he is perfect for our Animal Enrichment program.

Major is very determined and loves to sneak into the feed room and **will eat anything, including the hat on your head.** He keeps everyone at ‘Our Backyard’ on their toes.

Sponsoring Major Lazer **helps us to keep his hooves clipped and put food in his belly.**
