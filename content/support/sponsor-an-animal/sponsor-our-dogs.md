We have wonderful farm dogs at ‘Our Backyard’. 

**A dog's sense of smell is at least 40x better than humans** and some have such good noses they can sniff out medical problems.

**Dogs rely a lot on their sense of smell** to find food, potential dangers, and friends, so needless to say they sniff a lot.

Dogs make great** therapy animals** offering unconditional love, calming pats and hugs and are a big part of our Animal Enrichment programs.

**You will find our dogs roaming around and keeping an eye on everyone**, stopping for a pat and occasionally sneaking into the office for a cool nap.

Sponsoring our farm dogs **helps us to provide the best care and home for them to keep them happy and healthy.**
