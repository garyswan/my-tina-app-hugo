**Cadbury is a Jersey Cow**, which are the second most common breed in Australia. 

Cadbury was brought up being **bottle fed twice a day here at 'Our Backyard'.**

Other than being incredibly cute and calm, Cadbury grazes on the grass here at Our Backyard and **replenishes the topsoil with his nutrient-rich manure.**

Cadbury is also a very much loved member of our **Animal Enrichment sessions** as we learn about caring for him and working with him on the farm.

Cadbury is such a **warm and gentle cow** and fits in perfectly at 'Our Backyard'.
