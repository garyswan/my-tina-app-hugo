We have an **abundance of sheep that live at ‘Our Backyard’.**

Sheep are very hardy animals that can live in many places in many kinds of weather. **Our family of Sheep at ‘Our Backyard’ love their warm, sunny home.**

Our Sheep love hanging out in their little flock in our paddocks, it is lovely to watch them roaming around. **They keep our grass down and our farm tidy.**

Sheep can be flighty, so be** calm, approach quietly and touch gently.** They are so lovely and soft to pat!

You will find **Cecil, Wilbur, AJ, Barbara, Sean, Lamb Chops, Lady Bah Bah, Noodles, Pickles, Lambert and Cobber in our paddocks.**

Sponsor our sheep today so we can **keep their wool trimmed and bellies full!**
