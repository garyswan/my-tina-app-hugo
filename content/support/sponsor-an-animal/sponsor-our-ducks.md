‘Our Backyard’ is the **perfect playground for our Ducks.**

Did you know, ducklings have no waterproofing until they grow their adult feathers? **A duck's feathers are so waterproof** that even when the duck dives underwater, the downy underlayer of feathers right next to the skin will stay completely dry.

Ducks eat **grass, aquatic plants, insects, seeds, fruit, and fish.**

We love to watch the ducks **glide over the dams and waddle around the paddocks.** They also leave behind little droppings which are **great natural fertilisers for our paddocks,** keeping them green and healthy.

Our Ducks love to nest and raise new fluffy babies, which is wonderful for **everyone to enjoy and learn about the duck world!**

Sponsoring our Ducks **helps us feed and care for our ducks and all the new ducklings** we get at 'Our Backyard'.
