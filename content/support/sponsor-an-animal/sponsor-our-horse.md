Indi enjoys **eating roughage including grass, hay, loads of fresh rainwater and for special treats,** she likes mineral block and Himalayan salt.

Indi keeps everyone at ‘Our Backyard’ grounded. She plays a **huge part in our Animal Enrichment program bringing a calming presence to everyone around her.**

**Indi radiates love and understanding and can change any bad mood into a good one,** reminding us that we can choose the way we feel.

\*Indi had a broken wither as a young horse and has never been ridden.
