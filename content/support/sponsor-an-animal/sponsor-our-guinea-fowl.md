Guinea fowl might be a **strange-looking bird** but they’re becoming increasingly popular in Australian backyards.

We love our Guinea fowl because they are just so **loveable and full of personality.**

Guinea fowl are a hit with gardeners thanks to their insatiable appetite for **demolishing bugs and pest insects in the garden**, they are always on **grub patrol** here at ‘Our Backyard’.

Guinea fowl play a very important role here at ‘Our Backyard’ because their **loud warning cries serve as a perfect alarm system** against predators such as snakes and foxes, they are the protectors of all our furry and feathered friends.

If you listen carefully, you will hear our family of Guinea **fowl marching around the 15 acres of ‘Our Backyard’.**
