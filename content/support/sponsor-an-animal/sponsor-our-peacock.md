Meet Andrew the Peacock and his feathered friends!

Andrew the Peacock is the **most colourful bird at ‘Our Backyard’.**

Peacocks are best known for their **amazing eye-spotted tail feathers or plumage.**

Peacocks lose all of their tail feathers every summer, taking almost 10 months to grow new ones.

The Peacocks and Peahens at ‘Our Backyard’ mostly walk around looking **beautiful, they love showing off to our visitors with their gorgeous feathers.**

Listen and look out for Andrew. His feathers make a **rattlesnake-like noise** when he vibrates his beautiful tail into a colourful display.
