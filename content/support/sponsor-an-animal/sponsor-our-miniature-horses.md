We have three Miniature horses at ‘Our Backyard’, **Finn, Spicer and Clementine.**

Miniature horses are horses defined by their small height. Their colour and coat pattern can vary and they
are very friendly with people. 

Our miniature horses are gentle and play a huge part in our Animal Enrichment program **offering unconditional love, kindness and patience.**

Finn is a very gentle boy, we are working to help him build his confidence, so **approach him slowly, gently and quietly.**

Spicer is very **curious and friendly and loves all his adoring visitors.** Spicer has a magnificent mane that he loves to have brushed.

Clementine (Tiny) is **very sweet, loves to socialise** and loves her best mates Finn and Spicer.
