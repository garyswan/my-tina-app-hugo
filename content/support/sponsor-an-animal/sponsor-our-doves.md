The Doves at ‘Our Backyard’ are a **great reminder that spending time with birds can be a very peaceful and relaxing activity.** Move gently and quietly around them so as not to scare them.

Doves are one of the **few species of birds that drink by sucking up their water** instead of taking a bill full of water and letting it trickle down their throat. Doves can suck up their total daily requirement in less than 20 seconds.

White doves are **symbolic of new beginnings, peace, fidelity, love, luck and prosperity** and we feel they bring all of these things to ‘Our Backyard’.

Doves grace our visitors with their elegant presence. 

Sponsoring our Doves **helps us to keep them safe, warm and well-fed** while they grace our visitors with their elegant presence.
