In this program, participants learn about biology, plants, food and nutrition, the environment and develop teamwork skills by growing a garden together.

Our Horticulture Outdoor Classroom and Learning Gardens have been designed specifically as an experiential learning space that teaches individuals how to plant, grow, harvest and prepare a variety of herbs, fruits and vegetables.

Through this innovative program, participants learn how to maintain gardens by completing activities such as watering, thinning, pruning, weeding, fertilizing, mulching, composting and monitoring for pests and diseases.

Sunshine Butterflies experienced and knowledgeable staff lead you step by step through this program and help guide you through the process of growing your very own fresh and seasonal produce to enjoy with family and friends at home.
