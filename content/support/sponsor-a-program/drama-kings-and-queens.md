**Drama Kings & Queens**

‘Drama Kings & Queens’ is a fun theatre and music program aimed at assisting people with disability to express themselves and build confidence.

This program encourages individuals to come to life through creative expression.

Our Drama Kings & Queens program is designed for those with little to no experience but who have always wanted to sing or just love dressing up and being on stage!

Participants work throughout the year on multiple productions to be performed for friends, family and the local community.

**Give us a call on 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in this program, or any of our daily recreational, educational or life skills programs.**
