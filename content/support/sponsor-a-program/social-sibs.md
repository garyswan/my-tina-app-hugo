'Social Siblings' is an informal support group for siblings aged 8-12 years, that provides social and recreational activities, to give siblings of a person with disability an opportunity to meet other kids living in similar circumstances in a fun, safe, casual and friendly environment.

Siblings of a person with disability, can experience a range of emotional reactions, both positive and negative, which is why we have created a group exclusively just for them.

'Social Siblings' allows siblings to:

• Meet other brothers and sisters and build new friendships.  
• Have fun without the guilt of knowing their sibling can’t always enjoy the same activity or pleasure.  
• Talk about their feelings with others who really know what it’s like to have a sibling with disability.  
• Learn and develop coping strategies for some of those difficult situations that they may encounter, such as teasing or embarrassment.  
• Improve self-esteem and increase social interactions and begin to see their situation as normal.

If you have a brother or sister with disability, come and join our Social Sibs program for some fun-filled free activities.

Time: Once a month. Times vary according to the activities.

Ages: 8-12 years

For more info, or to book, please call us on 07 5470 2830.

This program is proudly supported by the [Sisters of Charity Foundation](https://sistersofcharityfoundation.com.au/).
