**Chippies Corner**

Chippies Corner provides opportunities for individuals with disability to design, create and construct wood products in a safe and supportive environment.

You will be guided step-by-step through each project to help you learn new woodworking skills and techniques.

The program is delivered by our enthusiastic Support Mentors who possess a passion to share their skills and knowledge with our members.

Items made or restored can be sold to the public and may include the construction of cutting boards and trays, surfboards, furniture items, herb stakes and garden planters, fruit and veggie boxes, homewares and picture frames, garden art and ornaments, bird boxes and toolboxes as well as recycled pallet furniture.

Sunshine Butterflies 'Chippies Corner' runs twice weekly.

**Give us a call on 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in this program, or any of our daily recreational, educational or life skills programs.**
