**Farmability** is an educational **farm animal, gardening and environmental program** that provides a unique learning experience to individuals with disability.

Farmability teaches practical hands-on skills through gardening methods, animal care practices and environmental sustainability.

In this innovative program, members will learn about where their produce comes from and how to care for animals and the environment.

Our knowledgeable staff will help guide you through the process of growing your very own fresh and seasonal produce including salads, veggies and herbs as well as harvesting fruit from our orchard to enjoy.

Participants will complete a variety of activities in the many natural outdoor learning spaces at â€˜Our Backyard. You will also visit surrounding farms around the Sunshine Coast, marketplaces and food manufacturers and distributors.

Our outdoor learning classroom and growing spaces offer an environment designed to increase confidence, knowledge, and create social connections.

If you are interested in **joining 'Farmability'** send us an enquiry or give us a call on 07 5470 2830 for more information.
