#### Farmyard Cooking School

Would you like to learn to cook easy healthy nutritional meals and enjoy delicious food while socialising with friends?

In our 'Farmyard Cooking School' program we cover all aspects of food preparation, including menu planning, learning how to follow recipes, safe food handling, correct measurement reading, cooking times and table setting.

Pick ingredients from our raised garden beds and hydroponic greenhouse. Learn how food grows and where your food comes from.

Our 'Farmyard Cooking School' is a great way to socialise with friends, working together to prepare a healthy and nutritious lunch to share, whilst learning important daily living skills.

**Give us a call on 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in this program, or any of our daily recreational, educational or life skills programs.**
