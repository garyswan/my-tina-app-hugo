**Metal Heads & Motors**

This program provides the opportunity to maintain and repair machinery by learning to use different tools.

Members of all abilities are guided step-by-step through each project to help learn new skills and techniques in a safe space.

Activities include welding and grinding and repairing tools, as well as learning to maintain a car motor by checking the oil and tyre pressure, change light bulbs and spark plugs, check the radiator and refill the screen wash, repairing mowers, blowers, whipper snippers and other small engines.

Enjoy offsite visits to tyre workshops to watch how tyres are balanced and changed, local mechanic workshops to watch all the busy action, as well as visits to local wreckers and a panel beaters workshops.

**Give us a call on 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in this program, or any of our daily recreational, educational or life skills programs.**
