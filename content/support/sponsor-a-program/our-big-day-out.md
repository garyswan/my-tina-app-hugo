**'BIG DAY OUT'**

Join us each week as we head out into the community for a day of fun activities and socialising.

Sunshine Butterflies Big Day Out is always full of great activities including Bowling, boat trips, and visits to Kenilworth, the Noosa National Park, Botanic Gardens and The Australia Zoo.

Each week is an exciting new adventure!

Get out and about in our beautiful natural environment and socialise with friends along the way.

**Give us a call on 07 5470 2830, if you would like to book your place in this program, or any of our daily recreational, educational or life skills programs.**
