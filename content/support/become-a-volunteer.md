Volunteers are a valued part of the Sunshine Butterflies team.

We feel so lucky to have a small but dedicated group of volunteers, who donate their time to our organisation each week.

As a volunteer, you can be involved in a variety of volunteer activities that will **provide many benefits to** those with disability in our community.

Volunteers carry out a range of tasks at ‘Our Backyard’, from caring for our farmyards and animals, assisting in our daily recreational and educational programs, to tending to our beautiful gardens and grounds.

These valued roles require **dedicated and reliable volunteers** who can commit on a consistent basis.

Our volunteers are so loved by our members and staff, and they contribute enormously to our organisation.

**It takes a special kind of person to give so generously and without expectation.**

If you would like to become one of our Volunteers, please contact us today!
